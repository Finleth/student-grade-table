# Student Grade Table
- A Content Management System for controlling the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of student data on a MySQL database.
- Utilized HTML for the structure of the page and Bootstrap for the UI and mobile-responsiveness along with CSS for additional styling.
- Used JavaScript for the functionality of the app along with jQuery for cross-browser compatibility DOM manipulation and AJAX for communication with my server.
- Developed a PHP back-end that performs data validation and sanitization before carrying out the CRUD operations requested by the client.
- Also created a Node.js server with the same functionality as the PHP server, along with the data validation and sanitization.
- Made a toggle for the client to switch between using the Node and PHP servers.
- Added a stored procedure to the MySQL database for sql injection protection and efficiency on update operation performance times.
